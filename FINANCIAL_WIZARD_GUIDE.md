## 🎯 **Example Conversations**

### **Scenario 1: New Investor**
**You:** "Hi Marcus, I'm 28 and just started investing. I have $5,000 saved and want to know how much I'll have in 30 years."

**Marcus:** "Great to meet you! Let me calculate that for you. $5,000 invested at a 7% annual return for 30 years would grow to approximately $38,061. That's the power of compound interest! What's your risk tolerance and what are your financial goals?"

### **Scenario 2: Retirement Planning**
**You:** "I'm 45, have $200,000 saved, contribute $1,500/month, and want $100,000/year in retirement. Am I on track?"

**Marcus:** "Let me analyze your retirement plan. With your current savings and contributions, you're projected to have about $1.2 million at 65. However, you'll need about $2.5 million for your desired income. You have a shortfall of about $1.3 million. I'd recommend increasing your monthly contribution by about $1,200 to get on track."

### **Scenario 3: Portfolio Review**
**You:** "Can you analyze my portfolio? I have $100,000 in tech stocks, $50,000 in bonds, and $25,000 in cash."

**Marcus:** "I'll analyze your portfolio allocation. You have 57% in stocks, 29% in bonds, and 14% in cash. Your risk level is moderate, but you're heavily concentrated in tech. I'd recommend diversifying into other sectors and potentially increasing your bond allocation for better risk management."

- "My portfolio is 70% stocks, 20% bonds, 10% cash - is this appropriate?"

### **2. Ask for Calculations**
- "Calculate compound interest on $15,000 at 8% for 25 years"
- "What would my mortgage payment be on $350,000 at 6% for 30 years?"

### **3. Request Education**
- "Explain the 4% rule for retirement"
- "Teach me about tax-loss harvesting"
